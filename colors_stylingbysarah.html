<p>This lovely pastel shade is a breath of fresh air for this autumn. Experimenting with colors not usually associated with the season keeps your wardrobe exciting. Lavender is the perfect shade that can upgrade your outfit with its soft yet bright personality.</p>

        <h3>Creamy Vanilla</h3>
<p>Lastly, this overlooked neutral is making a statement this season. Not off-white or pure white, but vanilla is the shade that we are looking for in our knits. This color adds the perfect amount of warmth while still remaining pure.</p>
