    <h2>Excuse me, are those your real...?</h2> 
    <p>By Sarah Grinnell</p>
    <p>The trend of semi permanent makeup has grown tremendously over the past few years. Whether it is microblading for those picture perfect eyebrows or eyelash extensions for that bright-eyed, glamorous look from the moment you wake up in the morning to the moment you say 'goodnight,'' these trends, along with others (like 'dip' for nails) is becoming a fast growing market. Do these trendsetters own the fact their eyebrows are tattooed on and their lashes are painstakingly, meticulously glued on every few weeks, or do they want you to think they are 'au naturale?' Are they cheating those of us who have to carefully draw in eyebrows every morning and curl and apply several coats of thick black mascara to our eyes, or are we cheating ourselves by not partaking in this time-saving, glamorous trend?
